    "longDescription": "Cards Against Humanity: Family Edition is a new party game that's just like Cards Against Humanity, except it's written for kids and adults to play together. Each round, one player asks a question from a black card, and everyone else answers with their funniest white card. We didn't just take the adult stuff out of the original game: we wrote a whole new game from scratch and tested it with thousands of families. If you like to laugh at stuff like “filling my butt with spaghetti,” this is the game for you. If you don't, go fill your butt with spaghetti!",
